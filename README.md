**Binomial Heap Implementation**
 Course: Data Structures
 
 Language: Java 21

Project Overview :

This project implements a Binomial Heap, a priority queue supporting efficient merge operations. The heap is implemented in Java 21, following theoretical principles studied in the course.

Features & Operations:

 insert(k, info) – Inserts a new item with key k and value info.
 
 findMin() – Returns the item with the smallest key.
 
 deleteMin() – Removes the smallest item.
 
 decreaseKey(x, j) – Decreases key of item x to j, maintaining heap structure.
 
 delete(x) – Deletes a specific item x from the heap.
 
 meld(heap2) – Merges the heap with heap2.
 
 size() – Returns the number of elements in the heap.
 
 empty() – Checks if the heap is empty.
 
 numTrees() – Returns the number of trees in the heap.
